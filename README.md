## Installation

Before using this collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install hitachivantara.vspone_block
```

```text
collections:
    - hitachivantara.vspone_block.sds_block
```

```text
collections:
    - hitachivantara.vspone_block.vsp
```

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the Ansible package.

```

If you need to install a specific version of the collection (for example, to downgrade due to issues in the latest version), you can use the following syntax to install version 4.5.1:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install hitachivantara.vspone_block:==4.5.1
```

### Create an LDEV with a specific LDEV ID

This example shows how to create a logical device (LDEV) with a specific ID, pool, and size.

```yaml
- name: Create LDEV with specific ID
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Create ldev
      hitachivantara.vspone_block.vsp.hv_ldev:
        connection_info: "{{ connection_info }}"
        state: "present"
        spec:
          ldev_id: 345
          pool_id: 15
          size: "1GB"
      register: result

    - name: Debug the result variable
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: result
```
