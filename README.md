    - The log files are located at `$HOME/logs/hitachivantara/ansible/vspone_block/hv_vspone_block_modules.log`.

    - Hitachi Ansible Storage Log Collection
        In the Ansible Module installation directory, the playbooks are located at `/opt/hitachivantara/ansible/vspone_block/tools`. The name of the playbooks are:
        - `logbundle_direct_connection.yml`
        - `logbundle_gateway_connection.yml`

        *There are two log bundle generation procedures each for gateway connect and direct connect.*
        - After executing the script, the resulting ZIP archive is named: e.g.`ansible_log_bundle_2024_06_04_23_28_44.zip` This log bundle is created in the `$HOME/logs/hitachivantara/ansible/vspone_block/log_bundles/` directory.
    - Set below environment variables to change the ansible log level, log directory and log file name
